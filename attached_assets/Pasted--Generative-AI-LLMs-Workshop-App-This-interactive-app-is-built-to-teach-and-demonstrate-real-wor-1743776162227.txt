🚀 Generative AI + LLMs Workshop App
This interactive app is built to teach and demonstrate real-world applications of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). It covers key concepts, tools, and use cases from the basics of Python to advanced LLM-powered chatbots using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

📚 Modules Covered
✅ Python Essentials for AI
Learn Python syntax, APIs, and data manipulation techniques using pandas, numpy, and real-world APIs.

🧠 Intro to Generative AI & LLMs
Explore Hugging Face models like GPT-2 and BERT. Try out text generation, summarization, and sentiment analysis using transformers.

🔍 Advanced LLM Concepts
Understand prompt engineering, tokenization, fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT), and experiment with temperature, top-k, and top-p decoding.

📄 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Combine LangChain and ChromaDB to build a chatbot that reads from custom documents, extracts context, and generates intelligent responses.

🤖 Mini Project – AI Chatbot with RAG
Upload PDFs or text files, ask questions, and get accurate answers using vector search + LLMs — all in a Gradio-powered UI.

📈 Trends & Evaluation
Explore Agentic LLMs (AutoGPT, LangGraph), Visual LLMs (LLaVA), and tools like Hugging Face Evaluate, LangSmith, and more.
