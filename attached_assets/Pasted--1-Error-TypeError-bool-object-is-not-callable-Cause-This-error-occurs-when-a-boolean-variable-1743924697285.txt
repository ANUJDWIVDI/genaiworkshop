‚úÖ 1. Error: TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable
Cause
This error occurs when a boolean variable has the same name as a function. In your case:

python
Copy
Edit
if is_admin(admin_username, admin_password):
If is_admin was previously declared as a boolean somewhere, like:

python
Copy
Edit
is_admin = False
Then calling it as a function is_admin(...) will trigger:

TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable

‚úÖ Fix
Rename either the function or the boolean flag to avoid name collision. Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def check_admin_credentials(username, password):
    return username == "admin" and password == "Admin123!"

# Usage
if check_admin_credentials(admin_username, admin_password):
    # proceed to admin dashboard
Or, make sure is_admin is not redefined as a boolean.

‚úÖ 2. Signup: Handling Optional Access Code
Problem
You want users to either:

Enter an access code, or

Leave it blank, which should automatically generate a request for access.

But the current form likely requires the access code.

‚úÖ Fix Strategy
Allow the access code field to be optional.

If left blank, save user data (username, email, password) in the database under a "pending approval" state.

Notify the user: ‚ÄúNo access code? A request for access has been generated.‚Äù

‚úÖ Backend Handling
python
Copy
Edit
if access_code.strip() == "":
    # store user with "pending_access": True
    db.users.insert_one({
        "username": username,
        "email": email,
        "password": hashed_password,
        "pending_access": True
    })
    st.success("Request sent! You'll be granted access soon.")
else:
    # validate code and register directly
‚úÖ 3. Login Error: SSL connection has been closed unexpectedly
Cause
This usually points to a network issue, SSL misconfiguration, or MongoDB Atlas free tier going idle.

‚úÖ Fixes
Ensure MongoDB Atlas cluster is not paused (free clusters go to sleep after inactivity).

Wrap DB connection with error handling:

python
Copy
Edit
try:
    client = pymongo.MongoClient(MONGO_URI, serverSelectionTimeoutMS=5000)
    db = client.get_database()
    client.admin.command('ping')  # test connection
except pymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError:
    st.error("Database connection failed. Please try again in a few seconds.")
Upgrade to a paid MongoDB tier or implement keep-alive pings to avoid auto shutdown.

‚úÖ 4. Reimagining the App: Unified, Polished & Seamless
Current Issues:
Separate login portals for admin and users

Abrupt flows

Hard-coded logic for admin login

Lacks real-time feedback, polish

‚úÖ Ideal Architecture & UX Redesign
Single Entry Point (Unified Login Form)
Use one login form. Determine admin/user role after authentication:

python
Copy
Edit
if email == "admin@example.com":
    # redirect to admin_dashboard()
else:
    # redirect to user_dashboard()
Improved Flow
Homepage: ‚ÄúWelcome to [App Name]‚Äù

Buttons: Login, Sign Up

Login Page:

Email / Username

Password

Forgot Password

Auto-detect admin & route accordingly

Sign Up:

Username, Email, Password, Confirm

Optional Access Code ‚Üí ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have one? Leave blank to request access.‚Äù

Feedback Handling:

Toasts (e.g., st.toast()) or snackbars

Inline field errors

Admin Dashboard:

View user requests

Approve / Deny access

User Dashboard:

Personalized view

Profile, Activities, Logout

‚úÖ 5. Design & UI/UX Improvements
üîπ Visual Design Improvements
Use a modern UI library like Streamlit Components or integrate TailwindCSS for web front.

Add logos, avatars, and user badges.

Replace hard transitions with progress animations.

Form validation in real-time with icons (‚úÖ, ‚ùå).

üîπ UX Enhancements
Auto-fill for email on login

Password visibility toggle

Tooltips for access code input

‚ÄúRemember me‚Äù toggle (with secure cookies or session)
